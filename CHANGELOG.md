# Changelog

All notable changes to EverShelf will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Generic shopping names** — Products are grouped by type ("Latte", "Affettato", "Pasta") rather than brand; computed via an expanded keyword map with Google Gemini AI as fallback for unknown products
- **Bring! auto-migration** — Existing list items with old specific names are silently migrated to generic names on every list load, throttled to once per 10 minutes
- **Bring! catalog coverage** — All 93 shopping_name values now resolve to a German Bring! catalog key (icons and categories in the Bring! app); 24 aliases added to cover previously unmatched names
- **Auto-add to Bring! on depletion** — When a product reaches zero the app adds it to Bring! automatically using the generic shopping name, with the specific product name and brand in the specification field
- **Finished-product confirmation banner** — Instead of silently deleting zero-stock entries, a banner prompts the user to confirm; banner title includes the last 3 digits of the product barcode for easier identification
- **Anomaly detection banner** — Dashboard notifications for suspicious inventory/transaction mismatches and consumption prediction errors, with one-tap inline correction
- **SSE recipe streaming** — Recipe generation streams live via Server-Sent Events; Gemini agent feedback is shown in real time as it is generated
- **Smart alert banners** — Configurable expired-only mode with explanatory messages; banner buttons are fully internationalized

### Fixed
- **Scale double-deduction** — Multiple BLE stable readings of the same weight no longer fire duplicate `inventory_use` events; JS preserves the confirmation sentinel on submit and PHP rejects a second `out` transaction for the same product within 12 seconds
- **Kiosk native TTS** — CI workflow now builds the APK on `develop` branch too; the native Android `TextToSpeech` bridge bypasses Web Speech API voice-availability issues without requiring offline voice packs
- **TTS voice loading** — Retries for up to 10 seconds on page load; shows a message if no voices are available and offers a manual refresh button
- **Bring! migration** — Corrected two bugs: wrong removal API (`DELETE /item` → `PUT remove=item`) and wrong purchase key sent to Bring! (Italian shopping name → German catalog key), which previously created Italian/German duplicate entries
- **Gemini 429 rate limiting** — API calls are retried with exponential backoff; recipe requests are capped at 5 per minute with a dedicated rate-limit bucket

### Performance
- **Gemini calls centralized** — All Gemini API requests go through a single `callGemini()` helper with intelligent backoff; Gemini removed from the product-selection and bringSuggest flows in favour of fast offline logic

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Expired product banner** — Dashboard notifications for expired products with use, throw away, edit, and dismiss actions
- **Expiring soon banner** — Dashboard notifications for products expiring within 3 days with use, edit, and dismiss actions
- **Priority-sorted notifications** — Banner alerts sorted by urgency: expired > expiring > suspicious quantities > consumption predictions
- **Swipe navigation** — Touch swipe left/right to browse banner notifications, with dot indicators and arrow buttons
- **Quick-access buttons** — Inventory page shows 4 recently used and up to 8 most popular products for quick selection
- **Recent & popular products API** — New `recent_popular_products` endpoint
- **Auto-refresh** — Banner notifications refresh every 5 minutes while on the dashboard
- **Edit from expiry banner** — Correct expiry dates directly from expired/expiring notifications

### Fixed
- **Negative scale values** — BLE scale readings with negative weight are now ignored
- **Banner re-appearing after edit** — Editing from a banner now persists the confirmation so it doesn't reappear on dashboard reload
- **False consumption predictions** — Manual inventory edits (updated_at > last restock) now use the correct baseline for prediction calculations
- **Kiosk overlay blocking header** — Removed injected exit/refresh buttons from the web app header in kiosk mode
